# Music Recommendation System

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A intelligent music recommendation system that suggests songs based on user preferences and listening patterns. Built using machine learning algorithms and collaborative filtering techniques.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends songs based on similar users' preferences
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests songs with similar audio features/metadata
- **Hybrid Recommendation**: Combines collaborative and content-based approaches
- **Web Interface**: Simple web demo to test recommendations
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large music catalogs

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-recommendation-system.git
cd music-recommendation-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- Flask (for web interface)
- Spotipy (Spotify API wrapper)

## Usage

### Data Preparation
Place your music dataset in `data/` directory. The system expects a CSV file containing:
- Track ID
- Artist
- Title
- Audio features (danceability, energy, tempo, etc.)

### Running the Recommendation System
```python
# Data preprocessing
python src/preprocess.py

# Train model
python src/train.py

# Generate recommendations
python src/recommend.py --user_id 123 --num_recommendations 10
```

### Web Interface
```bash
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your-spotify-client-id'
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your-spotify-client-secret'
python app.py
```
Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to access the recommendation interface.

- Acousticness
- Danceability
- Energy
- Instrumentalness
- Liveness
- Loudness
- Speechiness
- Tempo
- Valence
