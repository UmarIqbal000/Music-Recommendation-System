# Music-Recommendation-System
A Music Recommendation System can be built using Python by leveraging machine learning algorithms to recommend music based on user preferences, song features, or collaborative filtering. Below is a basic approach that combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques.

Explanation:
Dataset: We created a small dataset with song features like Genre, Tempo, and Energy.
Preprocessing: Categorical data (Genre) is converted to numeric using a simple mapping.
Feature Matrix: We combined all features (Tempo, Energy, and Genre) into a feature matrix. We also normalize the features for better similarity comparison.
Cosine Similarity: We used cosine similarity to calculate how similar each song is to the others.
Recommendation: Based on the similarity scores, we recommend songs similar to the one a user likes.

Advanced Approach:
For a more advanced recommendation system, you can combine Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering using libraries like Surprise, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. If you have access to user-song interaction data (e.g., user ratings), you can use Matrix Factorization or Deep Learning models for better recommendations.

Future Enhancements:
Collaborative Filtering: Use user preferences and ratings data to make recommendations.
Neural Networks: Implement a deep learning model for more personalized recommendations.
Hybrid System: Combine content-based and collaborative filtering for better accuracy.
